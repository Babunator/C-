# Data types
![](https://hackr.io/blog/media/2-34.png?ezimgfmt=rs:714x415/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1)
- **Built-in or primitive data types:** Pre-defined data types that can be used directly, including Integer, Character, Boolean, Floating Point, Double Floating Point, Valueless or Void, and Wide Character.
- **Derived data types: Derived from primitive data types**: function, array, pointer, and reference.
- User-defined data types**: Defined by users: class, structure, union, enumeration, and Typedef

# Variables

Variables store the data values. C++ supports various types of variables, such as int, double, string, char, and float. 
```cpp
int num = 12; // Integer (whole numbers)
string name = "Buddy"; // String(text)
char ch = 'U'; //single character
float fl = 5.99; // Floating point number with decimals
double Y_N = true // Boolean values with two states: true or false
```
- You can use alphabets, numbers, and the underscore for a variable name. 
. However, variables **cannot start** with numbers or the underscore ‘_’ character. 
- You cannot use a keyword for the variable name. 


## Variables Scope
###  Local Variables
- These variables are declared within a function or block of code. Their scope is only limited to that function or block and cannot be accessed by any other statement outside that block. 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
usingnamespacestd;

intmain () {
// Local variable:
int a, b;
int c;

// initialization
a = 10;
b = 20;
c = a + b;

std::cout << c;

return 0;
}
```
### Global Variables 
- Global variables are accessible to any function, method, or block of the program. Usually, it is defined outside all the functions. The value of the global variable is the same throughout the program. 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
usingnamespacestd;

// Global variable:
int g;

intmain () {
// Local variable:
int a, b;

// initialization
a = 10;
b = 20;
g = a + b;

std::cout << g;

return 0;
}
```

# Arrays
Arrays are derived data types that store multiple data items of similar types at contiguous memory locations.
´´´cpp
string vehicles [4]; //declaring array to store up to 4 variables.
string vehicles[4]= {"car", "scooter", "cycle", "bike"}; //initializing the array
´´´
## Accessing Array Values
You need to use the index number to access the elements stored in an array. 
´´´cpp
string vehicles[4]= {"car", "scooter", "cycle", "bike"};
cout << vehicles [0];
´´´
## Changing Array Elements
You can change the elements stored in an array using the index number. 
´´´cpp
string vehicles[4]= {"car", "scooter", "cycle", "bike"};
vehicles [0]= " "airplane";
cout << vehicles[0];
´´´
