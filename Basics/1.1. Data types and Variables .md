# Data types
![](https://hackr.io/blog/media/2-34.png?ezimgfmt=rs:714x415/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1)
- **Built-in or primitive data types:** Pre-defined data types that can be used directly, including Integer, Character, Boolean, Floating Point, Double Floating Point, Valueless or Void, and Wide Character.
- **Derived data types: Derived from primitive data types**: function, array, pointer, and reference.
- User-defined data types**: Defined by users: class, structure, union, enumeration, and Typedef

# Variables

Variables store the data values. C++ supports various types of variables, such as int, double, string, char, and float. 
```cpp
int num = 12; // Integer (whole numbers)
string name = "Buddy"; // String(text)
char ch = 'U'; //single character
double fl = 5.99; // Floating point number with decimals
bool y_n = true // Boolean values with two states: true or false
```
- You can use alphabets, numbers, and the underscore for a variable name. 
. However, variables **cannot start** with numbers or the underscore ‘_’ character. 
- You cannot use a keyword for the variable name.

## Variables Scope
###  Local Variables
- These variables are declared within a function or block of code. Their scope is only limited to that function or block and cannot be accessed by any other statement outside that block. 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
usingnamespacestd;

intmain () {
// Local variable:
int a, b;
int c;

// initialization
a = 10;
b = 20;
c = a + b;

std::cout << c;

return 0;
}
```
### Global Variables 
- Global variables are accessible to any function, method, or block of the program. Usually, it is defined outside all the functions. The value of the global variable is the same throughout the program. 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
usingnamespacestd;

// Global variable:
int g;

intmain () {
// Local variable:
int a, b;

// initialization
a = 10;
b = 20;
g = a + b;

std::cout << g;

return 0;
}
```
