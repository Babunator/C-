# Arrays
Arrays are derived data types that store multiple data items of similar types at contiguous memory locations.
```cpp
std::string vehicles [4]; //declaring array to store up to 4 variables.
std::string vehicles[4]= {"car", "scooter", "cycle", "bike"}; //initializing the array
```
## Accessing Array Values
You need to use the index number to access the elements stored in an array. 
```cpp
  std::string vehicles[4]= {"car", "scooter", "cycle", "bike"};
  std::cout << vehicles [0];    // --> car   
  return 0;
```
## Changing Array Elements
You can change the elements stored in an array using the index number. 
```cpp
std::string vehicles[4]= {"car", "scooter", "cycle", "bike"};
vehicles [0]= " "airplane";
std::cout << vehicles[0]; // --> airplane  
```
