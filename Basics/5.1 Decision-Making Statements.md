# If Statement
An if statement is used to test an expression for truth. If the condition is true, then the statements within are executed. Otherwise, the statements are skipped.
- Syntax:
```
if (expression)
{ //code}
```
- Example: 
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main () {
int b;
std::cout << "Type a number: ";
std::cin >> b; 
if( b < 20 ) {    //If statement to check if entered number is less than 20
std::cout << "Your number is less than 20;" << std::endl;
}
std::cout << "Value of your number is : " << b << std::endl;

return 0;
}
```

# If...Else Statement
This is an extension of the ‘if’ statement. It instructs the compiler to execute the ‘if’ block only if the specified condition is true. Otherwise, it executes the ‘else’ block. 
- Syntax:
```
if (expression)
{//code}
else
{//code}
```
- Example: 
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main () {
int b;
std::cout << "Type a number: ";
std::cin >> b; 
if( b < 20 ) {    //If statement to check if entered number is less than 20
std::cout << "Your number is less than 20;" << std::endl;
}
else {            //Else statement if the number is more than 20
    std::cout << "Your number is more than 20;" << std::endl;
}
std::cout << "Value of your number is : " << b << std::endl;

return 0;
}
```
# Else if Statement
 ``else if`` for two or more possible statements.
```
if (condition) 
    {some code} 
else if (condition)
    {some code} 
else 
    {some code}
````

# Switch Statement
- When you need to execute conditions against various values, you can use switch statements.
- The switch keyword initiates the statement and is followed by ``()``, which contains the value that each case will compare.
- Inside the block, ``{}``, there are multiple cases. The case keyword checks if the expression matches the specified value that comes after it. 
- The ``break`` keyword tells the computer to exit the block and not execute any more code or check any other cases inside the code block.
- At the end of each switch statement, there is a ``default`` statement. If none of the cases are true, then the code in the default statement will run. It’s essentially the else part.

- Syntax:
```
switch(expression) {
case constant-expression :
statement(s);
break; //optional
case constant-expression :
statement(s);
break; //optional

default : //Optional
statement(s);
}
```
- Example: 
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main () {

char grade; // local variable declaration:

std::cout << "Type your grade(A,B,C,D,F): ";
std::cin >> grade; 

switch(grade) {
case'A' :
std::cout << "Outstanding!" << std::endl;
break;
case'B' :
case'C' :
std::cout << "Well done" << std::endl;
break;
case'D' :
std::cout << "Pass" << std::endl;
break;
case'F' :
std::cout << "Try again" << std::endl;
break;
default :
std::cout << "Invalid grade" << std::endl;
}
std::cout << "Your grade is " << grade << std::endl;

return 0;
}
```
