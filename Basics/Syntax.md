# Syntax
```cpp
#include <iostream>
usingnamespacestd;

intmain() {
cout << "Hello World!";
return0;
}
```
- end each line with a semicolon ```;``` to specify the end of the line
- **Line 1**: ```#include <iostream>```specifies the header file library, which helps you deal with input and output objects like “cout.” Header files are used to add specific functionality to C++ programs.
- **Line 2**: ```using namespace std``` allows you to use names for objects and variables from the standard library.
- **Line 3**: Blank line. C++ ignores the spaces present within the code.
- **Line 4**: ```int main()```, which is a function. Any code within the curly brackets {} will be executed.
- **Line 5**: ```cout``` is an object used along with the insertion operator ```<<```(see out) to print the output text. 
- **Line 6**: ```return 0``` is used to end the main function.

- Comments in C++ can be single or multi-line and start with ```/*``` and close with ```*/```
- Comments can also start with ```//```, extending to the lines end.
