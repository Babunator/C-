# Errors

- **Compile-time errors**: Errors found by the compiler.
- **Link-time errors**: Errors found by the linker when it is trying to combine object files into an executable program.
- **Run-time errors**: Errors found by checks in a running program.
- **Logic errors**: Errors found by the programmer looking for the causes of erroneous results.

There are two types of **compile-time errors**:
- **Syntax errors**: Errors that occur when we violate the rules of C++ syntax.
  - e.g. missing semicolon ``;``
  - e.g. missing closing parenthesis ``)``, square bracket ``]`` or curly brace ``}``
- **Type errors**: Errors that occur when there are mismatch between the types we declared.
  - e.g. forgetting to declare a variable
  - e.g. storing a value into the wrong type

**Link-time Errors** are ,when the program needs some function or library that it can’t find. Some common link-time errors:
- Using a function that was never defined (more on this later)
- Writing ``Main()`` instead of ``main()``
Here’s an example of a link-time error message:<br/>

Errors which happen during program execution (run-time) after successful compilation are called **run-time errors**. It happens after the ./ execute command.
Run-time errors occur when a program with no compile-time errors and link-time errors asks the computer to do something that the computer is unable to reliably do.<br/>
Some common run-time errors:
- Division by zero also known as division error. These types of error are hard to find as the compiler doesn’t point to the line at which the error occurs.
- Trying to open a file that doesn’t exist.

Errors which provide incorrect output, but appears to be error-free, are called **logical errors**. Logical errors solely depend on the logical thinking of the programmer.<br/>
Some common logic errors:
- Program logic is flawed
- mistake in an if statement or a for/while loop
