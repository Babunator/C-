# While Loop
The loop will continue till the specified condition is true.
```
while (condition)
{code}
```
Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int i = 0;
  while (i < 5) {
    std::cout << i << "\n" ; //make new lines for each
    i++; //Add +1.
  }
  return 0;
 /* output - 1
             2
             3
             4
             5
   */                      
}
```
# Do-While Loop
When the condition becomes false, the do-while loop stops executing. However, the only difference between the while and do-while loop is that the do-while loop tests the condition after executing the loop. Therefore, the loop gets executed at least once.

}
while (condition)
```
# For Loop
You can use the for loop to execute a block of code multiple times. This loop runs the block until the condition specified in it holds false. 
```
for (int i=0; i< count; i++) //i++ Add +1.
{
Code
}
```
- The initialization of a counter: ``int i = 0``
- The continue condition: ``i < 20``
- The change in the counter (in this case an increment): ``i++``
# Break Statement
This is used to break the flow of the code so the remaining code isnâ€™t executed. This brings you out of the loop. <br/>
Example:
```
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
if (i == 4) {
break;
}
cout << i << "\n";
}
```
# Continue Statement
And the continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.<br/>
Example:

```
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
if (i == 4) {
continue;
}
cout << i << "\n";
}
```
