# Compile and Execute
- When you program in C++, you mainly go through 4 phases during development:
  - Code — writing the program
  - Save — saving the program
  - Compile — compiling via the terminal
  - Execute — executing via the terminal

- Compile: A compiler can translate the C++ programs that we write into machine code. 
- To compile a file, you need to type ``g++`` followed by the file name in the terminal and press enter:
``g++ hello.cpp``
- The compiler will then translate the C++ program ``hello.cpp`` and create a machine code file called ``a.out``.
- While Compiling you can give the output executable file a specific name. Write ``g++`` and the file name in the terminal. After that typee ``-o``
  -``g++ hello.cpp -o hello`` --> The compiler will then translate the C++ program hello.cpp and create a machine code file called hello.
  
- To execute the new machine code file, all you need to do is type ``./`` and the machine code file name in the terminal and press enter.
```
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
./hello
Hello World!
```
- The executable file will then be loaded to computer memory and the computer’s CPU (Central Processing Unit) executes the program one instruction at a time.
