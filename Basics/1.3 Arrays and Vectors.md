# Arrays
Arrays are derived data types that store multiple data items of similar types at contiguous memory locations.(**contiguous, indexable sequence of elements**)
```cpp
std::string vehicles [4]; //declaring array to store up to 4 variables.
std::string vehicles[4]= {"car", "scooter", "cycle", "bike"}; //initializing the array
```
## Accessing Array Values
You need to use the index number to access the elements stored in an array. 
```cpp
  std::string vehicles[4]= {"car", "scooter", "cycle", "bike"};
  std::cout << vehicles [0];    // --> car   
  return 0;
```
## Changing Array Elements
You can change the elements stored in an array using the index number. 
```cpp
std::string vehicles[4]= {"car", "scooter", "cycle", "bike"};
vehicles [0]= " "airplane";
std::cout << vehicles[0]; // --> airplane  
```
# Vectors
- The ``std::vector`` lives in the ``<vector>`` header. So first, we need to add this line of code at the top of the program: ``#include <vector>``
- And the syntax to create a vector looks like ``std::vector<type> name;``
- So to define a vector of ``int``s called ``calories_today``: <br/>
``cpp
std::vector<int> calories_today;
``
- We can create *and* initialize the vectors``location`` with specific values:<br/>
``cpp
std::vector<double> location = {42.651443, -73.749302};
``
- Another way we can initialize our vector is by *presizing*, or setting the size. Suppose we want to create and initialize a vector with two elements. However, we don’t know what values we want to add yet:<br/>
``cpp
std::vector<double> location(2);
``
## Indexing vectors
- An **index** refers to an element’s position within an ordered list. Vectors are 0-indexed, meaning the first element has index 0, the second index 1, and so on.
- Using the notation ``vector[index]`` with square brackets after the vector name and the element’s index number inside.<br/>
``cpp
std::vector<char> vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};
std::cout << vowels[1] << "\n"; // Will give the letter e
``

## Adding and Removing Elements
- To **add** a new element to the “back”, or end of the vector, we can use the ``.push_back()`` function.<br/>
``cpp
std::vector<std::string> dna = {"ATG", "ACG"};
dna.push_back("GTG");
dna.push_back("CTG");
``<br/>

- You can also **remove** elements from the “back” of the vector using **.pop_back()**.<br/>
``cpp
std::vector<std::string> dna = {"ATG", "ACG","GTG","CTG"};
dna.pop_back();
``<br/>

## Size of Vector
The ``.size()`` function returns the number of elements in the vector.<br/>
``cpp
  std::vector<std::string> grocery = {"Hot Pepper Jam", "Dragon Fruit", "Brussel Sprouts"};
  std::cout << grocery.size();  //prints the size of the vector grocery
``

### Iterating over vector soze with for loop
You can write a ``for loop`` that iterates from ``0`` to ``vector.size()``. You can use the counter of the for loop as the index.<br/>
``cpp
for (int i = 0; i < vector.size(); i++) {
 
  vector[i] = vector[i] + 10; // Changes every vector index by 10

``
