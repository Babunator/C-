# Arrays
Arrays are derived data types that store multiple data items of similar types at contiguous memory locations.(**contiguous, indexable sequence of elements**)
```cpp
std::string vehicles [4]; //declaring array to store up to 4 variables.
std::string vehicles[4]= {"car", "scooter", "cycle", "bike"}; //initializing the array
```
## Accessing Array Values
You need to use the index number to access the elements stored in an array. 
```cpp
  std::string vehicles[4]= {"car", "scooter", "cycle", "bike"};
  std::cout << vehicles [0];    // --> car   
  return 0;
```
## Changing Array Elements
You can change the elements stored in an array using the index number. 
```cpp
std::string vehicles[4]= {"car", "scooter", "cycle", "bike"};
vehicles [0]= " "airplane";
std::cout << vehicles[0]; // --> airplane  
```
# Vectors
- The ``std::vector`` lives in the ``<vector>`` header. So first, we need to add this line of code at the top of the program: ``#include <vector>``
- And the syntax to create a vector looks like ``std::vector<type> name;``
- So to define a vector of ``int``s called ``calories_today``: <br/>
``cpp
std::vector<int> calories_today;
``
- We can create *and* initialize the vectors``location`` with specific values:
``cpp
std::vector<double> location = {42.651443, -73.749302};
``
- Another way we can initialize our vector is by *presizing*, or setting the size. Suppose we want to create and initialize a vector with two elements. However, we donâ€™t know what values we want to add yet:
``cpp
std::vector<double> location(2);
``
