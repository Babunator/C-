# Syntax
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
```
- end each line with a semicolon ```;``` to specify the end of the line
- **Line 1**: ```#include <iostream>```specifies the header file library, which helps you deal with input and output objects like “cout.” Header files are used to add specific functionality to C++ programs.
- **Line 2**: Blank line. C++ ignores the spaces present within the code.
- **Line 3**: ```int main()```, which is a function. Any code within the curly brackets {} will be executed.
- **Line 4**: ```cout``` is an object used along with the insertion operator ```<<```(see out) to print the output text. 
- **Line 5**: ```return 0``` is used to end the main function. If no value is returned, the system will receive a value indicating successful
completion.
  - A return type ```void``` indicates that a function does not return a value.
  ```cpp
  void print_square(double x)
  {
    cout << "the square of " << x << " is " << square(x) << "\n";
  }
  ```

- Comments in C++ can be single or multi-line and start with ```/*``` and close with ```*/```
- Comments can also start with ```//```, extending to the lines end.

- ```using using namespace std;``` --> make names from std visible without std::
